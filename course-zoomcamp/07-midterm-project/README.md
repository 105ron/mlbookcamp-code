## 7. Midterm Project

The idea is that you now apply everything we learned so far yourself.

That will include:

* Thinking of a problem that's interesting for you and finding a dataset for that
* Describing this problem and explaining how a model could be used
* Preparing the data and doing EDA, analyzing important features
* Training multiple models, tuning their performance and selecting the best model
* Exporting the notebook into a script
* Putting your model into a web service and deploying it locally with docker
* Bonus points for deploying the service to the cloud
